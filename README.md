# IoT Solutions for Home Automation
 
A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project serves as an initial framework for a Flutter application designed to control various applications within my home using NodeMCU or Raspberry Pi. It features color-changing buttons for easy differentiation between on (green) and off (grey) states. Additionally, the application updates Firebase with "1" when the light is switched on and "0" when it is switched off.
